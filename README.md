- **User-Friendly Interface:** A web-based UI built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Model Deployment:** Saved models using `pickle` for future use and web-based deployment.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model assessment.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub



## Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available datasets related to Parkinson’s disease, lung cancer, heart disease, thyroid disorders, and diabetes. Each dataset undergoes preprocessing for optimal performance.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Model Training:** Implementing and training Logistic Regression & SVM models.
3. **Evaluation:** Measuring model accuracy and optimizing hyperparameters.
4. **Deployment:** Making the models accessible via a web-based application.

## Model Performance
| Disease | Best Model | Accuracy |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Heart Disease | Logistic Regression | 88% |
| Lung Cancer | Logistic Regression | 93% |
| Thyroid Disorders |Logistic Regression | 95% |
| Diabetes |Logistic Regression| 77% |
| Parkinson’s | SVM | 88% |

## Future Enhancements
